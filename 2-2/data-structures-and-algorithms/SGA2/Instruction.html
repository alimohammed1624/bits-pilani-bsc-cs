Instructions for the auto-graded lab:

   You must enter your code in the .c file only in Coursera Labs.

   The locations where the user has to enter their code are clearly specified as comments in the required "areas" of the .c
   file.

   Enter your code only in those specific locations and not anywhere else.

   Carefully read the requirements of the question and the test case outputs to understand the expectation clearly.

   Carefully read all the inline comments and instructions, and follow them to the point while writing the code, especially
   the printf statement.

   Avoid making any changes to the existing code, especially in the printf() and scanf() statements.

   You are encouraged to use the variables already declared in the program when you write your code to implement the
   required logic. Avoid declaring or initializing any new variables.

   You must submit your assignment within the 1-hour time window for the successful submission of your assignment. Please
   note that no auto-submit option is available if the timer runs out.

   You must tick the honor code on a pop-up screen once you click the submit assignment button.

   The assignment supports partial grading based on completing each set of operations successfully.

   The best score out of the three submissions within the 1-hour window will be considered your final score for the
   assignment.
