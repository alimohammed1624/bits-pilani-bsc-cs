Write a function that takes the adjacency matrix of a tree as input and prints the tree's level-order traversal. The elements should be printed in 
ascending order given by the level-order traversal of the tree going from left to right in a level(i.e. Start from node 0 and print the nodes in 
ascending order of this level.  Let's call it level 1. After printing all the nodes of level 1, start level 2 by printing the children of the first 
node in level 1 in ascending order, then the children of the second node in level 1 in ascending order, and so on).

The root node of the tree is always node 0

An example of the operation is shown below.
INPUT       OUTPUT

6           0 1 2 3 8 42 56
0 1
0 2
1 3
1 8
2 56
2 42
